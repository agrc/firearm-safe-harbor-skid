This skid maintains an ArcGIS Online feature service for all of the law enforcement locations that are available to [receive firearms for safekeeping](https://bci.utah.gov/firearm-safe-harbor-storage-locations/) if the owner cohabitant or cohabitant believes that the owner cohabitant or another cohabitant with access to the firearm is an immediate threat to a cohabitant, the owner cohabitant, or another individual.

[Utah Code Title 53, Chapter 5a, Part 5](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title53/Chapter5A/53-5a-S502.html)

This skid is executed on demand by BCI employees with access managed by a Google Group. BCI manages the source data in a Google Sheet in a DPS-Firearm Map shared drive.
